# react-node-boilerplate
Boilerplate for rapid app building with React, Node.js and Express. For hackathons, quick prototypes and scratch work.

## Getting started (`frontend`)
[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is used as the bundler and build tool for a basic React.js application.

To start the dev server (port 1234 by default):
```
$ yarn dev
```

To build the application (`build` directory by default):
```
$ yarn build
```

## Getting started (`backend`)
Minimal Node.js and Express setup with `nodemon` as a development tool.

To develop:
```
$ yarn dev
```

To start the application:
```
$ yarn start
```
